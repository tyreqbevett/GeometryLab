# Geometry Calculator

This Java program is a console-based geometry calculator that allows the user to calculate:

- Area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle
- Perimeter of a rectangle or triangle
- Circumference of a circle

The program demonstrates the use of static methods, including both void methods and value-returning methods. It also includes method calls with parameters and user input through the Scanner class.

## Topics Covered

- Void methods and value-returning methods
- Arguments and parameters
- Functional decomposition
- Static method structure
- Scanner for user input
- Use of Math.PI for geometric calculations
